<h1><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>LETTER,
&amp;c.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> able Prelate of the Irish
section of the Latin Church once observed&mdash;&ldquo;The chief
points to be discussed between the Church of Rome and of England
are&mdash;the Canon of the Sacred Scriptures, Faith,
Justification, the Mass, the Sacraments, the authority of
tradition, of Councils, of the Pope, the celibacy of the Clergy,
language of the Liturgy, invocation of Saints, respect for
images, prayers for the dead.&nbsp; On most of these it appears
to me that there is no essential difference between (Roman)
Catholics and Protestants; the existing diversity of opinion
arises, in most cases, from certain forms of words which admit of
satisfactory explanation, or from the ignorance or misconceptions
which ancient prejudice and ill will produce and
strengthen,&mdash;but which could be removed; they are pride and
points of honour which keep us divided on many subjects, not a
love of christian humility, charity, and truth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; Thus wrote the celebrated Bishop
Doyle in the year 1824.&nbsp; Was he right or was he wrong?&nbsp;
Are the differences between the two Churches so <i>very</i>
slight that there is <i>no material</i> difference?&nbsp; If this
be so, my Lord, permit me, with all respect for your rank as an
English Nobleman, to ask you on what plea you have left the
Communion of the English Church, and alienated the consecrated
House of God at Pantasa from her service, for that of the
dissenting body to which you have joined yourself?&nbsp; Bishop
Doyle wrote either truth or falsehood in the above passage.&nbsp;
If truth, have you left the Church of your Baptism and of your
country for a system of foreign production, &ldquo;no material
difference, meanwhile, existing between them.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
falsehood, I might leave you to settle this matter with one of
the ablest Romish Bishops of modern times.&nbsp; But, my Lord,
there <i>is</i> a &ldquo;material difference&rdquo; between the
two Churches&mdash;a difference as great as between light and
darkness&mdash;<i>the</i> difference between Scriptural verities,
and the unfounded figments of Tridentine manufacture.&nbsp; To
prove this as briefly as may be, is my object in addressing
you&mdash;and I humbly hope that the perusal of this letter may
be blessed to your good, and that, as St. Cyprian would
speak&mdash;you may prove not like the raven who seduced from the
Catholic faith, returned to it no more; but, like the dove
departing from the ark of <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>God, but finding no rest for the sole
of its foot, returned to it again, with an olive branch of peace
in its mouth.</p>
<p>The first of the &ldquo;chief points&rdquo; is: &ldquo;the
Canon of the sacred Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this point it were easy to multiply testimonies.&nbsp; Let
Cardinal Bellarmine&mdash;without exception, the greatest
controversialist the Church of Rome can boast of, speak
first.&nbsp; His words are, <a name="citation4a"></a><a
href="#footnote4a" class="citation">[4a]</a> &ldquo;all those
books which the Protestants do not receive; the Jews also did not
receive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, my Lord, you are, of course, aware
that &ldquo;to the Jews were committed the oracles of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii. 2.&nbsp; Moreover, that our blessed
Saviour while he pointedly condemned the Jews for &ldquo;making
void the word of God by their traditions,&rdquo; never blamed
them for omitting any part of that word; but on the contrary
expressly recognises the Jewish Canon of the Holy
Scripture.&nbsp; Luke xxiv. 44.&nbsp; Nor did any of the Apostles
ever censure them for omitting from the holy volume any portion
of God&rsquo;s revealed Will.&nbsp; I need not, I presume, inform
you, my Lord, that the Ancient Catalogues of the books of Holy
Scripture reject what we call the Apocrypha; nor, if you have
ever read those ancient writings, need I tell you, that they
contain statements opposed to Scripture, to reason, and to fact.
<a name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a>&nbsp; It may not be unproductive of
good also to inform you, my Lord, that on the publication of the
Complutensian Polyglot, by Cardinal Ximenes, Archbishop of
Toledo, <i>so late as the</i> 16<i>th</i> <i>Cent</i>: the
preface expressly rejects the apocryphal books of Tobit, Judith,
Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, the additional chapters of Esther, and
the Maccabees. <a name="citation4c"></a><a href="#footnote4c"
class="citation">[4c]</a>&nbsp; While if we are to be guided by
your infallible Church of Rome regarding the Canon of Holy
Scripture, we must reject the Epistle to the
Hebrews,&mdash;perhaps the most important of the
Epistles,&mdash;for, according to the undeniable testimony of St.
Jerome, this Epistle was once rejected by the Latin Church.&nbsp;
Perhaps Dr. Newman&rsquo;s system of &ldquo;Developement&rdquo;
may be extended from doctrines to facts, and make the Church
which once rejected an inspired Epistle and now receives it,
equally right, at each period, owing to the amazing spell of
infallibility.&nbsp; With all these facts before you, I think, my
Lord, that <i>this</i> &ldquo;point of difference&rdquo; might be
easily settled.&nbsp; I pass on to the next on which I will
remark&mdash;viz.&mdash;<i>The Mass</i>.</p>
<p>Your great Cardinal Bellarmine considers this essential to
Christianity.&nbsp; Yet I will venture to assert that no
professing Church would entertain the awful notion of a
<i>propitiatory</i> sacrifice to the Almighty now&mdash;since the
atonement made by the holy one and the just once for all on
Calvary,&mdash;unless with the determination to <i>outbrave</i>
the direct testimony of inspiration that &ldquo;there is <i>no
more offering</i> for sin.&rdquo; <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Heb. x. 18. <a
name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a>&mdash;With this intention it may be, my
Lord, that the Latin Church now receives the Epistle to the
Hebrews,&mdash;just as, receiving the Gospels in which our Lord
commands &ldquo;Drink ye <i>all</i> of this&rdquo; wine in the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, she &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo;&mdash;it
is her own word&mdash;(&ldquo;<i>non obstante</i>&rdquo; in the
Council of Constance) prohibits the people from receiving it, and
thus, in palpable opposition to Christ&rsquo;s command, robs them
of that &ldquo;Cup which we bless,&rdquo; and which &ldquo;is the
communion of the blood of Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a>&nbsp; But this doctrine of the mass
must stand or fall, according to your own confession, with the
Romish figment of <i>transubstantiation</i>.&nbsp; Now, my Lord,
what is the proof of this doctrine?&nbsp; We are referred by
Romish writers to Matt. xxvi. 26. seq. and John vi. 63.
seq.&nbsp; But hear what some of the ablest writers, on your side
of the question, acknowledge with respect to these alleged
proofs.&nbsp; Your celebrated Dr. Lingard, &rsquo;tis true, tells
us that the latter place, viz., &ldquo;John vi. contains the
clearest proof of the Roman Catholic doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
what say Doctors equally celebrated in their day, and no less
anxious advocates for the peculiarities of Romanism?&nbsp; Biel,
a well-known Romish authority, in Can. mis, and Cusan and
Cajetan, both Cardinals, and Thomas Aquinas, your &ldquo;Angelic
Doctor,&rdquo;&mdash;declare, that this &ldquo;clearest
proof,&rdquo; <i>does not refer to the subject at all</i>!&nbsp;
I will add, my Lord, because Romanists&mdash;however loud in
their call &ldquo;tell it unto the Church&rdquo;&mdash;the Church
with them always meaning their particular Priest&mdash;seem again
unwilling to be guided by the opinion of individual
Ecclesiastics.&nbsp; I will add, I say, that your own
&ldquo;infallible&rdquo; Council of Trent, while luxuriating in a
&ldquo;<i>twofold</i> interpretation&rdquo; of this passage, and
scorning to be &ldquo;reduced to the poverty of one,&rdquo; does
not dare to <i>pronounce</i> that it refers to the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper. <a name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c"
class="citation">[5c]</a>&nbsp; But&mdash;supposing that it has
that reference,&mdash;which I believe it has
prospectively,&mdash;surely our Saviour&rsquo;s own commentary
upon the discourse is worth a thousand glosses of all the
Schoolmen&mdash;&ldquo;It is the Spirit that quickeneth,&rdquo;
He says, &ldquo;the flesh profiteth nothing, the words that I
speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
John vi. 63. <a name="citation5d"></a><a href="#footnote5d"
class="citation">[5d]</a>&mdash;But we are also referred to <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the words of
institution in Matt. xxvi. 26.&mdash;seq.&nbsp; Now if I do not
very much mistake, your friend, Cardinal Wiseman, decides that
this place is destructive of the tenet for which he adduces
it.&nbsp; He says in his &ldquo;Lectures on the Eucharist&rdquo;
that in a sentence where &ldquo;two material objects are
represented as identical, we must plainly understand the passage
figuratively.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Catechismus ad
Parochos&mdash;otherwise called the Catechism of the Council of
Trent, says, &ldquo;When instituting this Sacrament our Lord
himself said &lsquo;this is my body;&rsquo; the word
&lsquo;<i>this</i>&rsquo; expresses the entire substance of the
thing present; and, therefore, if the substance of the bread
remained, our Lord could not have said, &lsquo;<i>this</i> is my
body.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Undoubtedly it was what Christ held in
his hand that he designated by the word
&ldquo;<i>this</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, independent of the
consideration that it was impossible for our blessed Saviour to
hold His Own Body in His Own Hand, I ask what was
<i>that</i>?&nbsp; The Romish opinion is&mdash;that the bread was
not changed until our Saviour had pronounced the last of these
words&mdash;&ldquo;this is my body.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this be true,
then, it was bread when the word &ldquo;<i>this</i>&rdquo; was
used, and consequently the bread must have been referred to by
that word.&nbsp; Apply then to this reasoning the indubitable
Canon of Dr. Wiseman&mdash;Lec. p. 180.&mdash;That &ldquo;it is
obviously necessary to fly from the literal meaning of texts
which represent two material objects as identical.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
will detain your Lordship for a moment or two longer on these
words of institution.&nbsp; Do you rest your faith in
transubstantiation on these words?&nbsp; I ask, then, my Lord, by
what process you conclude that the words &ldquo;This <i>is</i> my
body,&rdquo; mean &ldquo;<i>Let</i> this <i>be</i> my
body.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter clearly denote
<i>conversion</i>,&mdash;the former, according to all
phraseology, can denote nothing of the sort.&nbsp; Or
again&mdash;with all reverence let me ask it&mdash;whether does
your Lordship profess to eat the mortal or the immortal body of
your Saviour in participation of the Eucharist?&nbsp; If the
former, I suppose St. Paul is explicit in refutation, for he
tells us that &ldquo;Christ dieth no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. vi.
9.&nbsp; If the latter, I presume the words of institution will
not much help you, for when they were spoken Christ had no
immortal body to bestow.&nbsp; On this &ldquo;point&rdquo; I will
add no more but that your Prince of Controversialists, the author
of what Dr. Wiseman calls &ldquo;Magnificent
Controversies,&rdquo; plainly confesses that &ldquo;most learned
and acute Romanists believe that there is no place of Scripture
so express as <i>without the authority of the Church</i>
evidently to compel a reception of
transubstantiation.&rdquo;&nbsp; De Sac: Euc: 1. iii. c.
23.&nbsp; The value of the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; of the Latin
Church will not be very highly estimated by any unprejudiced
person moderately acquainted with her principles and
practices.</p>
<p>I pass on to the third &ldquo;point,&rdquo;
viz.&mdash;<i>Tradition</i>.&nbsp; Read the following description
of your traditions by your own celebrated Dr. Milner, of the
&ldquo;<i>end</i> of controversy&rdquo; notoriety.&nbsp; In the
twelfth letter of his <i>conclusive</i> work he
says&mdash;&ldquo;There are among Catholics divine traditions * *
* and there are among many Catholics historical and even
<i>fabulous traditions</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this point I need add
no more except to assure you that no sensible Anglican will ever
question that <i>written</i> tradition is a valuable auxiliary in
the interpretation of Scripture; while <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>any one acquainted with the wretched
fables of oral traditionary transmission in the Church of Rome
will heartily unite in the language of Archdeacon Jortin, that
&ldquo;it is a muddy stream of everlasting nonsense.&rdquo; <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>I come now to the Authority of Councils:&mdash;and here,
<i>what</i> Councils are meant?&nbsp; If I mistake not the Pope,
as you call him, is bound by the decrees of only eight.&nbsp; And
surely what are sufficient for &ldquo;His Holiness&rdquo; might
well be deemed quite enough for his &ldquo;Subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yet De la Hogue tells us that there are eighteen.&nbsp; There may
have been this number, or twice as many, if the Doctor pleases;
but can he, or Dr. Wiseman, or any other Doctor induce you or any
reasonable man to believe that Councils which contradict each
other have all emanated from the spirit of unity and truth?&nbsp;
Do I misrepresent them?&nbsp; Let us see,&mdash;and to be as
brief as I can, let one instance suffice.&nbsp; The Council of
Ephesus decreed&mdash;&ldquo;That it should not be lawful to
utter, write, or compose any other faith than that which had been
defined by the Nicene Fathers; and that if any dared to offer
<i>any other Creed</i>, if Ecclesiastics, they should be removed
from their office; if laics, that they should be
anathematised.&rdquo;&nbsp; Labb. et Coss. Concil. t. 3. p.
688.&nbsp; Compare with this, my Lord, <i>the Creed of Pope
Pius</i>, according to the Council of Trent, and then I ask you
to answer to your own conscience whether the assembly at Trent,
which you call a General Council, was not in direct and
irreconcilable opposition to one of the four universally received
General Councils of the Church?&nbsp; Let this suffice on the
subject of Councils,&mdash;and now we approach the so called
&ldquo;<i>Pope</i>&rdquo;&mdash;not, you may rely upon it, to
kiss his toe, or to join in &ldquo;his adoration;&rdquo; for who
is the Pope, my Lord?&nbsp; You say he is the Vicar of Christ,
and the successor of St. Peter.&nbsp; But let St. Bernard correct
this rashness&mdash;&ldquo;They have not the inheritance of St.
Peter,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;who have not the faith of
Peter.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should like to know which of St.
Peter&rsquo;s writings or which of his traditions contains the
twelve New Articles of the Creed of your Pope&rsquo;s
Church.&nbsp; And as to his being the Vicar of our holy Redeemer
let me recommend to you the following passage from the book of
Homilies of that Church which you have so unaccountably
forsaken&mdash;&ldquo;As the Lion is known by his claws, so let
us learn to know these men by their deeds.&nbsp; What shall we
say of him that made the noble King Dandalus to be tied by the
neck with a chain, and to lie down before his table, there to
gnaw bones like a dog?&nbsp; Sabel. Ennead. 9. lib. 7.&nbsp;
Shall we think that he had God&rsquo;s holy Spirit within him,
and not rather the Spirit of the devil?&nbsp; Such a tyrant was
Pope Clement the Sixth.&nbsp; What shall we say of him that
proudly and contemptuously trod Frederic the Emperor under his
feet, applying that verse of the Psalm unto himself, <i>thou
shall go upon the lion and the adder</i>, <i>the young lion and
the dragon thou shalt tread under thy foot</i>.&nbsp; Ps.
91.&nbsp; Shall we <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>say that he had God&rsquo;s holy Spirit within him, and
not rather the Spirit of the devil?&nbsp; Such a tyrant was Pope
Alexander the Third.&nbsp; What shall we say of him that armed
and animated the son against the father, causing him to be taken
and cruelly famished to death, contrary to the law both of God
and also of nature.&nbsp; Shall we say that he had God&rsquo;s
holy Spirit within him, and not rather the Spirit of the
devil?&nbsp; Such a tyrant was Pope Pascal the Second.&nbsp; What
shall we say of him that came into his popedom like a fox, that
reigned like a lion, and died like a dog?&nbsp; Shall we say that
he had God&rsquo;s holy Spirit within him, and not rather the
Spirit of the devil?&nbsp; Such a tyrant as Pope Boniface the
Eighth.&nbsp; What shall we say of him that made Henry the
Emperor, with his wife and young child to stand at the gates of
the city in the rough winter barefooted and bareleged, only
clothed in linsey woolsey, eating nothing from morning to night,
and that for the space of three days?&nbsp; Shall we say that he
had God&rsquo;s holy Spirit within him, and not rather the Spirit
of the devil?&nbsp; Such a tyrant was Pope Hildebrand, most
worthy to be called a firebrand, if we shall term him as he hath
best deserved.&nbsp; Many other examples might here be alleged,
as of Pope Joan the harlot, that was delivered of a child in the
high street going solemnly in procession; of Pope Julius the
Second, that wilfully cast St. Peter&rsquo;s keys into the river
Tibiris; of Pope Urban the Fifth, that caused five Cardinals to
be put in sacks and cruelly drowned; of Pope Sergius the Third,
that persecuted the dead body of Formosus his predecessor, when
it had been buried eight years; of Pope John the Fourteenth of
that name, who, having his enemy delivered into his hands, caused
him first to be stripped stark naked, his beard to be shaven, and
to be hanged a whole day by the hair, then to be set upon an ass
with his face backwards towards the tail, to be carried round the
city in despite, to be miserably beaten with rods, last of all to
be thrust out of his country, and to be banished for ever.&rdquo;
<a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; Were these, let me ask you, my
Lord, successors of St. Peter, and Vicars of our Lord Jesus
Christ?&nbsp; Oh the blasphemy of such a thought!&nbsp; Oh the
<i>strong</i> delusion which must produce such a notion!&nbsp; I
ask, again, were these the <i>infallible</i> heads of the Church
of Rome?&nbsp; But <i>you</i> perhaps do not believe in the
Infallibility of the Pope: you only assert his Supremacy.&nbsp;
Each being equally unfounded, I only now remind you of the words
of your famous Bishop Doyle&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Whether we believe
the Pope to be infallible or not to be infallible</i>, <i>we are
equally good and orthodox Catholics</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a></p>
<p>The next &ldquo;point&rdquo; upon our list is the <i>Celibacy
of the Clergy</i>.&nbsp; It is very true that St. Paul said that
he would that all men were even as he&mdash;that is single.&nbsp;
But this was during a time of persecution when families would
have been irksome and injurious to Christian Missionaries.&nbsp;
But the same Apostle when giving <i>permanent</i> instructions
concerning the Clerical body directs&mdash;&ldquo;a Bishop must
be blameless the husband of one wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Tim. iii.
2.&nbsp; &ldquo;One that ruleth well his own house, having his
children in subjection with all gravity.&rdquo; v. 4. <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>And again v.
12&mdash;&ldquo;let the Deacons be the husband of one
wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, my Lord, did your fallen Church labour
to be identified in Apostacy with the heretics of the first
centuries, how could she have better succeeded than in
&ldquo;<i>forbidding to marry</i>?&rdquo; 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2,
3.&nbsp; And now, hear, from your own authors, the fearful
consequences of a celibate Clergy.</p>
<p>Claud D&rsquo;Expence a very celebrated Parisian divine,
writes thus&mdash;&ldquo;Shameful to relate they give permission
to Priests to have concubines, and to live with their harlots,
who have children by them, upon paying an annual tribute, and in
some places they oblige Priests to pay this tax saying they may
keep a concubine if they please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Espen: Com: ad Cap.
1. ad Tit. Dig: 2.</p>
<p>Hear again, how your Cardinal Baronius
writes&mdash;&ldquo;What then was the face of the Roman
Church?&nbsp; How very filthy when the most powerful and sordid
harlots then ruled at Rome, at whose pleasure Sees were changed,
and Bishopricks were given, and what is horrible to hear and most
abominable&mdash;their gallants were obtruded into the See of
Peter, and made false Popes; for who can say they could have been
lawful Popes who were intruded by such harlots without law?&nbsp;
There was no mention of the election or consent of Clergy, the
Canons were silent; the decrees of Popes suppressed; the ancient
traditions proscribed,&mdash;lust, armed with the secular power,
challenged all things to itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bar: Ann: <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 912.</p>
<p>This is the system of a celibate Clergy for which you, my
Lord, have forsaken that Church which honors &ldquo;holy
Matrimony&rdquo;&mdash;knowing that the Apostle declares that
&ldquo;Marriage is honorable in all.&rdquo; Heb. xiii. 4. <a

<p>Our next &ldquo;point&rdquo; is&mdash;<i>Prayer in the Latin
language</i>, of which I presume there was a fair specimen at
your late proceedings at Pantasa.&nbsp; It would be a waste of
words to write much upon this subject.&nbsp; I will therefore
merely remind you of the statement of St. Paul in 1 Cor. xiv.
19.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the Church I had rather speak five words with
my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also, than
ten thousand words in an unknown tongue,&rdquo; which compels
Cardinal Cajetan to acknowledge&mdash;inloco&mdash;that &ldquo;it
is more for edification that prayers should be offered in a
language understood by Clergy and people, than in
Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our next point is&mdash;<i>the Invocation of Saints</i>.&nbsp;
All Romish writers of the <i>present</i> day seem unanimous in
asserting and practising this awful idolatry.&nbsp; There were
some few before who seemed to shrink from it.&nbsp; Your Dr.
Milner does not found the practice on holy Scripture but
tradition.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true that he refers to
Scripture&mdash;Letter xxxvi. but suddenly,&mdash;evidently from
seeing the weakness of his
references,&mdash;says,&mdash;&ldquo;The Church, however, derived
her doctrine on this subject from the Apostles, <i>before the New
Testament was written</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas, my Lord, how you
&ldquo;make void the word of God by your tradition!&rdquo;&nbsp;
What saith our Lord and Master?&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt worship
the Lord thy God, and <i>Him </i><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span><i>only shalt thou
serve</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Am I to be told that it is only forbidden
to give latria, or supreme adoration, to any but the
Almighty?&nbsp; Your words latreia and douleia are indifferently
used in the Bible.&nbsp; <i>Here</i> you are forbidden to give
<i>the one</i> to any being except God.&nbsp; In 1 Sam. vii. 3.
you are forbidden to give <i>the other</i> to any creature.&nbsp;
How then can you reconcile, with the orders of your God, the
following most awful prayers?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fly to thy protection, O holy Mother of God; despise
not our prayers in our necessities, but <i>deliver us from all
dangers</i>, O glorious and blessed Virgin.&rdquo;&mdash;Bishop
Riley&rsquo;s Catechism, Dub. 1830. p. 10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most pure Virgin, conceived without sin, <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a> Thou art the sure refuge of penitent
sinners, with reason therefore, I have recourse to
Thee.&rdquo;&mdash;Novenas of the B. V. Mary.&nbsp; Dub. 1833. p.
4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lady of Heaven and earth,&rdquo; &amp;c., Ib. p.
12.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most prudent Virgin, who by redeeming thy Son Jesus
Christ, according to the law, didst co-operate in the salvation
of the world; rescue our poor souls from the slavery of sin, that
we may be always pure before God.&nbsp; Hail
Mary.&rdquo;&mdash;Ib. p. 21.</p>
<p>St. Joseph, who for so many centuries had actually no
commemoration in the Roman calendar, is now exalted to a height
of glory, from which the rest of the blessed company are
excluded&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no saint in heaven I worship like
Thee,<br />
Sweet spouse of our Lady!&nbsp; O deign to love me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And St. Mary is actually made our mediatrix with
him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With her babe in her arms surely Mary will
be,<br />
Sweet spouse of our Lady! my pleader with Thee.&rdquo; <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh! my Lord, as you value His glory who is a jealous God,
cease from such refuges of lies as Popery holds out to
you.&mdash;As you value the Salvation of your soul continue not
to serve the creature beside, yea more than, the Creator who is
blessed for evermore.&nbsp; Pray to him whose attribute it is
that He hears prayer, and whose gracious promise is that He will
answer it.&nbsp; Dare to show yourself inconsistent, by flinging
off the trammels by which you are bound.&nbsp; And may God direct
you by his blessed Spirit to the frame of mind of him who
cried&mdash;&ldquo;Whom have I in heaven but Thee, and there is
none upon earth that I desire in comparison of Thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ceasing to look to Saints or Angels or deified men and women, may
you be directed to the one mediator between God and man, the man
Christ Jesus, and may your attitude be, while here below, not
looking to Saint Mary, or any other creature, but &ldquo;looking
unto Jesus.&rdquo; <a name="citation10c"></a><a
href="#footnote10c" class="citation">[10c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Our
next &ldquo;point&rdquo; will be, &ldquo;<i>respect for
images</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bishop Doyle worded this very
cautiously.&nbsp; But <i>do</i> you pay no more than
&ldquo;<i>respect</i>&rdquo; to your images?&nbsp; My Lord, if
words have any meaning, Romanists worship images&mdash;they give
them religious service.&nbsp; Let us see for a moment.&nbsp; The
Second Council of Nice says&mdash;&ldquo;The honor paid to the
image <i>passes</i> to the prototype: and he who <i>adores</i>
the image, adores in it the person of him whom it
represents.&rdquo;&nbsp; Labb: vol. vii. p. 556.&mdash;Here is an
evident assertion of the &ldquo;adoration of images.&rdquo;&nbsp;
While you cannot, my Lord, fail to observe the striking identity
of language of this so called Christian Council with that of the
heathen idolaters&mdash;&ldquo;not that gold and
silver&rdquo;&mdash;say they,&mdash;&ldquo;when fashioned into
statues are gods, but that <i>through</i> these images the
invisible Gods are honoured and worshipped.&rdquo; <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; And Cardinal Bellarmine, if I
remember rightly&mdash;says, that &ldquo;it is most certain that
the Nicene Council decreed that <i>images are to be adored with
the highest worship</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, my Lord, this Council
is one of your eighteen General Councils.&nbsp; Oh how, then,
shall I characterise this idolatry?&nbsp; We pity the poor
heathen who bow down to stocks and stones, but what is
<i>their</i> guilt when compared with that of members of
Christ&rsquo;s baptized family committing the <i>same
crime</i>?&nbsp; I may be threatened by those who know no better
with the anathema of your &ldquo;holy &AElig;cumenical
Council,&rdquo;&mdash;for verily it <i>does</i> curse
enough,&mdash;&ldquo;cursed be the breakers of
images,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;cursed be they who refuse to salute
the holy and venerable images.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, my Lord, this
antiscriptural and irrational anathema will only turn tenfold
into the bosoms of its impious pronouncers, while I would with
all earnestness call your Lordship&rsquo;s attention to a curse
which I pray God you may never experience, although you are in
the fair way for earning it&mdash;viz.&mdash;Deut xxvii.
15.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or
molten image</i>, <i>an abomination unto the Lord</i>, the work
of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret
place.&nbsp; And all the people shall answer and say,
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next &ldquo;point&rdquo; is&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Prayers for
the Dead</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Your lately appointed
Cardinal&mdash;Dr. Wiseman&mdash;connects this
&ldquo;point&rdquo; with the doctrine of Purgatory
thus&mdash;&ldquo;the practice is essentially based on the belief
in Purgatory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lec. ii.&nbsp; Now although it is
quite evident that Dr. W.&rsquo;s learning is to a great extent
<i>second hand</i>, <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a> there can be no <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>question of
his learning by any one who has read his &ldquo;profoundly
learned work,&rdquo; as I think Mr. Hartwell Horne calls his
Hor&aelig; Syriac&aelig;; yet it does appear strange that he
should, as here, completely confuse things so very
different.&nbsp; Dr. Wiseman must be aware, as every tyro in such
matters is, that prayers were offered for the dead long before a
Purgatory was dreamed of.&nbsp; One of the Doctor&rsquo;s own
references proves this, viz.&mdash;1 Maccabees xii.
43.&mdash;where we read that <i>that</i> prayer was made in
reference <i>to the resurrection</i>,&mdash;not to release from
purgatory.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is said, that if Judas had
not hoped that the dead should rise again, it had been a
&ldquo;superfluous thing to pray for the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Prayer for the dead in the early Christian Church had a reference
to the same, or to an augmentation of their glory&mdash;for they
prayed even for the saints and martyrs.&nbsp; Such prayers for
the dead, then, could have had no reference to the doctrine of
Purgatory, the fire of which, Bellarmine, if I remember, states
to be the same as that of hell, differing only in duration.&nbsp;
I therefore dismiss such a <span
class="GutSmall">PRACTICE</span>, and will say a little on the
<i>doctrine</i> upon which, according to Dr. Wiseman, it is
founded.&nbsp; That is&mdash;the doctrine of
<i>Purgatory</i>.</p>
<p>On this &ldquo;point&rdquo; I will first observe, that your
most able men have declared it utterly incapable of proof from
the holy Scripture, and also that it is in opposition to the
doctrine of the ancient Church.&nbsp; Let us hear a few on each
statement.&nbsp; It is incapable of proof from holy
Scripture.&nbsp; As to this <i>general</i> statement we have the
following among others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Purgatory was for a long
time unknown, and <i>either never</i>, or <i>very seldom
mentioned among the ancient fathers</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bishop
Fisher&mdash;in refut: Luther.&mdash;And, a Romish Bishop whose
&ldquo;<i>discussion amicale</i>&rdquo; you are no doubt well
acquainted with, observes, that, &ldquo;Jesus Christ has not
revealed the knowledge of Purgatory, so that we can, therefore,
only form conjectures on the subject, more or less
probable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vol. ii. p. 242.&nbsp; As to the Scripture
proofs alleged by Dr. Wiseman, and others, your own writers
plainly assert their insufficiency.&nbsp; The places usually
quoted <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>are: Matt. v. 25, 26. and Matt. xii. 32., 1 Cor. iii.
15. <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a> and 1 Pet. iii. 18, 19.&nbsp; Now, my
Lord, without at all entering into an examination of those
places, which my limits will prevent, and which has been
unanswerably done a thousand times, I simply remark&mdash;That
St. Matt. v. 25, 26. has been given up as a proof by your great
Maldonatus who says the prison spoken of is hell.&nbsp; St. Matt.
xii. 32. has been abandoned by Card: Bellarmine who confesses
that the sin there spoken of was never to be forgiven.&nbsp; He
also confesses that the fire spoken of in 1 Cor. iii. 13. is not
meant of Purgatory,&mdash;by what process he extracts it, then,
from the 15 v. was perhaps best known to himself: and 1 Pet. iii.
18, 19.&mdash;has been given up by Father Maguire, a great
champion among you. <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; This being
the case, may we not well conclude that there is no foundation in
holy Scripture for the doctrine of Purgatory&mdash;the
acknowledged foundation of prayers for the dead, according <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>to Dr.
Wiseman,&mdash;and which, therefore, fall with it.&nbsp; I am
happy in adding the testimony of your celebrated Picherellus that
St. John by the one text&mdash;Rev. xiv. 13.&mdash;&ldquo;put out
the fire of Purgatory.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, my Lord, as Meagher
observes&mdash;&ldquo;The doctrine of Purgatory is of heathen
origin, intended to cheat the simple out of their money, by
giving them bills of exchange upon another world for cash paid in
this, without any danger of the bills returning
protested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, my Lord, I call on you, as a man of sense, as a man
of honesty, as a man wishing the salvation of your neverdying
soul, to reject a doctrine &ldquo;which would rob the believer of
his peace, which would throw around the glorious attributes of
Heaven&rsquo;s Sovereign the funereal pall of darkness, and
obscurity, which would transform a God of love into a God of
terror, mingle our paltry satisfactions with the agonies of
Calvary, and attach to the seamless robe of Christ&rsquo;s
righteousness woven from Bethlehem to the Cross, the tattered
vestments of personal suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sacraments are another &ldquo;point&rdquo; of difference
mentioned by Bishop Doyle.&nbsp; You say that there are
seven,&mdash;we say that there are &ldquo;two only as generally
necessary to salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our two Sacraments are, as
you are aware&mdash;&ldquo;Baptism and the Supper of the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Your five additional Sacraments are:
<i>Confirmation</i>, <i>Penance</i>, <i>Extreme Unction</i>,
<i>Holy Orders</i>, <i>and Matrimony</i>. <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; On these, little need be
said.&nbsp; The universally received definition of a Sacrament
excludes all of them.&nbsp; For what is a Sacrament my
Lord?&nbsp; Our Church Catechism defines it thus, in accordance
with St. Augustine&mdash;&ldquo;an outward and visible sign of an
inward and spiritual grace given unto us, <i>ordained by Christ
Himself</i>, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge
to assure us thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; A like definition is given by
your own writers.&nbsp; Thus the <i>Catechismus ad
Parochos</i>&mdash;de Sac. and Bishop Bossuet&mdash;Expos: de la
doc. de l&rsquo; Egl: Cath. cap. ix.</p>
<p><i>Confirmation</i> is a sacred rite and of Apostolic
origin.&nbsp; But where did Christ institute it?&nbsp; No
where.&nbsp; It, therefore, is not a Sacrament.&nbsp;
<i>Penance</i> is a godly discipline, if practiced after a godly
sort, but it was never instituted by Christ, and consequently is
not a Sacrament.&nbsp; One of the parts of Penance, according to
your Church, is Confession.&nbsp; And here, one feels a
difficulty in addressing a married nobleman of your persuasion,
or a bachelor with female relations and friends.&nbsp; Oh my Lord
are you aware of the filthy questions to which married ladies are
subject in the Confessional of the Church of Rome?&nbsp; They may
not yet have been proposed to any of <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span><i>your</i> friends: policy, on the
part of the wily party with which you have connected yourselves,
may have hitherto prevented it.&nbsp; But you ought to be
informed that there is a printed catalogue of the questions which
bachelor Priests of your unholy system are in duty bound to
propose to married, as well as unmarried, females.&nbsp; Have you
read this catalogue, my Lord?&nbsp; If you <i>have</i>, your
common decency is for ever obliterated from the annals of your
family, if any female friend of your&rsquo;s, under your control,
ever confesses to a Romish Priest.&nbsp; If you have <i>not</i>,
as you value even a respectable position in society, read the
instructions given to Priests, for hearing Confession, as given
in Dens and Baillie, the Maynooth Class books, before you allow
any female friend of your&rsquo;s to attend such
Confession.&nbsp; I will not pollute these pages by giving you
even an abstract of them.&nbsp; <i>They are filthy&mdash;they are
loathsome</i>, <i>they are beyond description disgustingly
offensive</i>.&nbsp; Break the shackles, my Lord, with which you
have voluntarily bound yourself: dare to assert yourself a free
man.&nbsp; Were you chained to the plough as a slave, your
<i>mind</i> might be free; but your <i>soul</i> is enchained by
the Church of Rome.</p>
<p><i>Extreme Unction</i> is your next Sacrament.&nbsp; The
Council of Trent goes no farther&mdash;except in its <i>Canon</i>
as before shown&mdash;than to say that Christ
&ldquo;<i>insinuated</i>&rdquo; this &ldquo;<i>as it
were</i>&rdquo; a Sacrament.&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">INSINUAVIT</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">TANQUAM</span>&rdquo;&mdash;while their
reference to James v. 14. is suicidal, for the
words&mdash;&ldquo;the Lord shall raise him
up&rdquo;&mdash;<i>&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;</i>
<a name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a>&mdash;show that it has no reference to
the dying, which indeed your Cardinal Cajetan
confesses&mdash;inloco&mdash;where he also denies the Tridentine
&ldquo;<i>insinuation</i>&rdquo; of our Lord.&nbsp; Titular
Bishop Doyle informs us also&mdash;p. 101.&mdash;of his
&ldquo;Abridgement of the Christian Doctrine&rdquo;&mdash;or
rather his edition of.&nbsp; Tubbervill&rsquo;s older
work&mdash;&ldquo;the time is uncertain&rdquo; when Christ
&ldquo;instituted Extreme Unction.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>Uncertain</i>!&nbsp; I had thought that nothing <i>could</i>
be uncertain to an &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; Church.</p>
<p>Your next additional Sacrament is: <i>Holy Orders</i>.&nbsp;
Now, my Lord, although &ldquo;it is evident unto all men
diligently reading the holy Scripture and ancient authors that
from the Apostles&rsquo; time there have been these Orders of
Ministers in Christ&rsquo;s Church&mdash;Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons,&rdquo; yet it no where appears that Christ himself
instituted them.&nbsp; I call upon you, then, either to reject
Holy Orders as, or refuse your definition of, a Sacrament.&nbsp;
The last of your additional Sacraments is <i>Matrimony</i>. <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; I had thought that Matrimony was
instituted <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>in the time of man&rsquo;s innocency; but your
infallible Church, by her definition of a Sacrament, and by
pronouncing this one, decides the contrary.&nbsp; I will only
further remark here, that it is most marvellous that a Church
which so honors and exalts Matrimony as to make it a Sacrament,
should deem it too <i>polluting</i> for those whom she
exclusively calls &ldquo;<i>Spirituals</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith and justification&rdquo; are the only other
points of difference alluded to by Bishop Doyle. <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; On these I prefer to give you the
decisive statements of the Bible.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that
<i>believeth</i> and is baptised shall be saved, and he that
<i>believeth</i> not shall be damned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark
xvi.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Believe</i> on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acts xvi. 31.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
conclude that a man is <i>justified by faith without the deeds of
the law</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii. 28.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the works
of the law shall no flesh be <i>justified</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gal.
ii. 16.&nbsp; My Lord, &ldquo;there is none other name under
heaven given among men whereby we must be saved, but the name of
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died, the Just One instead of the
unjust ones, that he might bring us to God.&nbsp; His blood
cleanseth from all sin.&nbsp; And although to <i>you</i>
&ldquo;there be Gods many, and Lords many,&rdquo; to <i>us</i>
there is but One&mdash;The Father, the Creator,&mdash;the Son,
the Redeemer,&mdash;the Holy Ghost, the Sanctifier, for
&ldquo;these three are one.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 John v. 7.</p>
<p>And now, my Lord, I have done.&nbsp; I offer no apology for
addressing you.&nbsp; I trust you may be enabled to thank me,
however unworthy, for having done so.&nbsp; I offer no apology
for my manner of writing to you.&nbsp; I have endeavoured to show
you &ldquo;the error of your way,&rdquo; and if I have used
&ldquo;great plainness of speech&rdquo; &ldquo;it is what I could
attain unto,&rdquo; and what I desired.&nbsp; That God may show
you the fearfulness of the step you have taken&mdash;the
grovelling bondage under which you have placed yourself, and
rescue you from that bondage, before it be too late, when your
eyes shall have closed upon everything of earth once and for
ever, is my fervent prayer; and with every good wish for you, and
for the unconscious partner in your guilt,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I beg to subscribe myself,<br />
<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,<br />
Your well-wisher, and obedient humble servant,</p>

<p>Some readers of the foregoing Letter may have expected to find
in it some allusion, at least, to what Gavazzi calls &ldquo;the
broken faith of Lord Fielding.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have purposely
avoided any remarks on the subject; and do not think it necessary
to account for the omission.</p>

or invalidate the former, p. 186.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are readers who, without any intimation from
me&rdquo;&mdash;writes Dr. Turton&mdash;&ldquo;will be aware of
my astonishment at the sight of the foregoing extract from the
<i>reply</i>; and every reader will be enabled to form some
judgment on the subject, when I state, that the <i>Meletamata
Sacra</i> and the <i>Commentary on St. John</i> are <i>the same
work</i>.&nbsp; And thus Dr. Wiseman, <i>after</i> treating
familiarly of &ldquo;the learned Titman&rdquo;&mdash;after
quoting the <i>Meletamata Sacra</i>&mdash;after supposing that
the Cambridge Professor was unacquainted with that work&mdash;Dr.
Wiseman, I say, after all this&mdash;writes himself down, either
as a person who did not know that the work, called <i>Meletamata
Sacra</i>, <i>is a</i> Commentary&mdash;<i>the</i>
Commentary&mdash;<i>Titman&rsquo;s</i> Commentary&mdash;on St.
John&mdash;or as one who aimed at inducing people to believe that
the <i>Meletamata Sacra</i> and the <i>Commentary</i> are
different productions. * * * Now, whether this misrepresentation
proceeded from ignorance or design, there is something about it
so wrong&mdash;wrong in such a manner and to such a
degree&mdash;that I have the greatest difficulty in deciding upon
my future course.&nbsp; If I could persuade myself that Dr.
Wiseman had ever had the <i>Meletamata Sacra</i> open before him,
I should certainly stop here.&nbsp; No earthly consideration
could induce me to add another sentence to these observations. *
* * * If Dr. Wiseman <i>was</i>&mdash;as he professed to
be&mdash;acquainted with the <i>Meletamata Sacra</i>, he has used
language, respecting that work, and myself, which, as I have
already intimated, must effectually preclude all further
attention, on my part, to his <i>Reply</i>.&nbsp; If, again, he
really was <i>not</i>&mdash;as he professed to
be&mdash;acquainted with that work, still his language cannot but
raise great doubts with regard to the course that ought to be
pursued.&nbsp; In truth Dr. Wiseman&rsquo;s proceeding, even when
viewed in the most favorable light, is so marked by every thing
that is contrary to propriety, and excites so much suspicion as
to the rest of his book, that my undertaking has now become
irksome beyond expression.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Turton&rsquo;s
Observations on Dr. Wiseman&rsquo;s Reply.&nbsp; p. 130 to
135.</p>
<p>I will here add that Dr. Turton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;suspicions&rdquo; have been more than realised as regards
Dr. Wiseman&rsquo;s performances.&nbsp; Dr. Wiseman tells us in
the preface to the first edition of his &ldquo;Lectures, p.
viii.&rdquo; that &ldquo;he has in general drawn his quotations
of the fathers from the useful compilation of Messrs. Kirk and
Barrington.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the address &ldquo;to the
reader&rdquo; in the second edition of this work we are informed
that &ldquo;the venerable Prelates (Dr. Poynter and Dr. Trevern)
and many other Catholic writers, have made use of the Faith of
Catholics in their publications.&rdquo; p. p. vii. viii.&nbsp;
Now what is the fact, as regards this Romish text book?&nbsp; Let
the title of the following book give you some
idea&mdash;&ldquo;Romish Misquotation: or certain passages from
the Fathers, adduced in a work entitled&mdash;&ldquo;the Faith of
Catholics,&rdquo; &amp;c., brought to the test of the originals,
and their perverted character demonstrated, by the Rev. Richard
T. P. Pope.&rdquo;&nbsp; A work which verifies its title beyond
the possibility of refutation.</p>
<p>Since the above went to press I have looked into titular
Bishop Doyle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Analysis of Divine
Faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; I find that he also used Barrington&rsquo;s
Compilation.&nbsp; His words are: p. 176: &ldquo;The testimony of
these witnesses&rdquo;&mdash;the fathers&mdash;&ldquo;I shall
insert here, copied or translated from the original records, by
the late Rev. Joseph Barrington, whose fidelity and accuracy in
this respect, has never, to my knowledge, been impeached or even
suspected.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will only say here, that a more gross
and unprincipled misrepresentation and perversion of the
testimony of the Ancients was never published.&nbsp; See
Pope&rsquo;s Roman Misquotation.&nbsp; London.&nbsp; Holdsworth.
1840.</p>
<p>Mr. Faber in his last edition of &ldquo;the Difficulties of
Romanism&rdquo; has left little for any one else to say in proof
that the Fathers are opposed to the peculiarities of the Latin
Church.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true that Mr. Husenbeth has published a
ponderous reply&mdash;approaching to a thousand pages.&nbsp; Mr.
Faber&rsquo;s little pamphlet demolishes the huge affair.&nbsp;
Its title is: as well as I remember&mdash;&ldquo;An Account of
Mr. Husenbeth&rsquo;s refutation of the argument of the
Difficulties of Romanism, upon the entirely new principle of a
refusal to meet it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The testimony of the Syrian Fathers alleged by Dr. Wiseman in
favor of the doctrine of transubstantiation in particular, is
shown to be thoroughly adverse to it by the great and good Doctor
Lee.&nbsp; See his Visitation Sermon.&nbsp; I am really surprised
that Dr. Wiseman could ever have appeared in public after the
publication of Dr. Lee&rsquo;s Sermon: yet, perhaps, one
<i>might</i> have been prepared for such want of common
propriety, by his previous conduct, after Dr. Turton&rsquo;s
triumphant exposure of him and of his arguments.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
